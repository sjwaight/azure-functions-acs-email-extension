# Sample Azure Function Binding for Azure Communication Service Email Services

NOTE: this is not official Microsoft software and should in no way be used for production scenarios.

The goal of this solution is to demonstrate how you can build your own custom extension for Azure Functions. 

In this scenarios I am building an extension that allows the Azure Functions codebase to send emails using Azure Communication Services Email Service in much the same way as you have previously been able to using SendGrid.
